# intel-mcs-example
Example parser for Intel's MCS-86 File Format. See
(this)[http://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/476.html] page as a reference to
the ASCII structures. From what I can tell it was defined as part of (The 8086
Family Users
Manual)[http://www.ceibo.com/eng/datasheets/Intel_8086_Family_Users_Manual.pdf].
